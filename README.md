Random scripts I worked on

# scraper.py
scraper.py is a Python script that simplifies the usage of three different scraping APIs (ScraperAPI, ScrapingBee & Wintr - to use this script, it is necessary to be registered with these services and to genereate API keys).
Best used as a replacement for requests, scraper.py checks the free tiers of the scraping services and scrapes provided urls with the service with the most remaining free api calls.
